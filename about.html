                    My name is John and living the simple life saved my life
                </h1>
                <p>
                    <strong>I used to be a pack rat.</strong>
                    I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the
                    truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there
                    was too much.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that
                    I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship
                </p>

                <h3>How I turned things around</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong
                        >I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of
                        everything</strong
                    >
                    I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold
                    my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my
                    job.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such
                    a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.
                </p>

                <h3>Now I live the simple life</h3>
                <p>
                    Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much
                    better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I
                    have more free time to enjoy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With how much it turned my life around,
                    <strong
                        >I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I
                        did it,</strong
                    >
                    and how others can benefit from living a simple life as
                    well, which is why I started this site!
